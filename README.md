# Blurred Cube

WebGL port of [my old openFrameworks experiment](https://github.com/shuhei/blurredCube) as an exercise of what I learned through [webgl-workshop](https://github.com/stackgl/webgl-workshop).

## Development

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open another terminal and serve static assets. I use `koko` for quick hack:

```
npm install -g koko
koko -o
```
